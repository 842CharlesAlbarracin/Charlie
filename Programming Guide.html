    These commands are required to start and end in order for it to actually work. so if the program seems to have a problem check if there are spelling mistakes, open strings, wrong order of ending. then if not contact me and ask what maybe wrong with the program. but this is how to de-bug it. And now the fact that you may not know the correct ending sequnce just do less then, and then slash to make it automatic and repeat until fixed if required.
