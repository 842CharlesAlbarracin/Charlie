    <em>Dear Crush</em>
</h2>
<p>
    I am shy to say your name in a letter like this but I will put it like this...
</p>
<p>
    I like you... Not because of your looks, That's just the bonus. Since I met you and saw you I must confess. I started to like you but was too shy to say it to you. And The fact that when I started to know you even more you were nothing but open to me. You were so welcoming and just kind... And also the fact that we have the same sense of humor. From my jokes as a sit-down comedian from the bananas to lil diablo, I am thankful you entered my life. I know you like someone else and I respect that. And a 2 year age gap sure but I know one thing... Its better then a 5 year age gap <b><i><em>EHM EHM JAZZET</em></i></b> but you might think it's weird I understand I can do the Herbert the Pervert Impression so it's fine. I will say this a day before the after party so yeah or like a week before cause there is still the after party. So that's it I guess Thankss for being such a good friend/victim <b><i><em>EHM EHM JAZZET</em></i></b> JKJK AHAHAHA Byee
