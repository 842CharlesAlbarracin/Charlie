    <h3 style="font-size:17.5">
Because the Archduke of Austria-Hungary was killed by a serbian man in Sarajevo during a visit. And this caused Austria-Hungary and its ally Imperial Germany with its Kaiser to Declare wasr on serbia. But Serbia is allied to Russia that is also allied by France and the United kingdom/Great Britain somewhat but not exactly because french and british relations were tense due to their former wars against each other. But in the end Germany and Austria-Hungary is the Central Powers versus the Allies which are Russia,France,United Kingdom/Great Britain, and in the later part the United States.
